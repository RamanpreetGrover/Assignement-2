I successfully implemented two approaches to filter, map, group, sort, and print user information based on their height, weight, and country.

Promises Implementation: I used Promises to handle the asynchronous steps, chaining operations like filtering, sorting, mapping, and grouping, and finally printing the user data in a structured way.

Async/Await Implementation: I utilized async/await to make the asynchronous operations look synchronous, which improved readability. This approach also handled the same filtering, sorting, mapping, and grouping tasks, but in a more streamlined and intuitive manner.

Both approaches grouped users by country and ensured that only users who met the height and weight criteria were processed. Additionally, the list of users was sorted by height in ascending order, and their information was printed in an organized format.
